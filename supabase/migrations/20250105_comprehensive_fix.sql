  # Comprehensive Database Fix

  ## Issues to Fix
  1. RLS policies not working properly
  2. Missing horse_id column in players table
  3. Missing columns in game_scores table
  4. Ensure all migrations are applied correctly

  ## Solution
  - Apply all missing schema changes
  - Fix RLS policies
  - Ensure proper permissions for anonymous users
